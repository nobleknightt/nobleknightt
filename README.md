## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Ajay**. I'm a developer who loves to write code, build software, and solve problems (though, sometimes those problems are tougher than they seem! ðŸ˜…).

### What I do:
- Building random projects (because why not?) and learning new things (hopefully) ðŸŒ±
- Trying to solve LeetCode problems (they are challenging ðŸ¤¯, but that's the fun part!)
- Learning a new programming language (or twoâ€¦ or three... okay, maybe more)
- Enjoying anything software-relatedâ€”especially diving into the internals and how things work under the hood! (still figuring it out! ðŸ˜…)

By the way, nice to see you here! ðŸ˜Š Hope you're having a great day!

Meanwhile, you can check some of my projects. (It's not much, but honest work! ðŸ˜Š)

Below are some more info about me if you want.

#### :wave: Hi, my name is Ajay. 
I am developer (pragmatic pessimist maybe?), trying to craft softwares (not succeeded in that so far :stuck_out_tongue:).  
So far, I have used, Python, FastAPI, JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS and Selenium.

I love learning anything (even remotely) related to software development - mostly the internals of any software.

Currently, I am learning,
- Golang
- AWS

Some of my favourite things are,
- List comprehension in Python (loves to one-liners whenever possible)
- React + TailwindCSS + Vite (best for my not-so-good projects)
- Github Actions (Give it a try)

I am interested in Compiler Design, Cryptography, Machine Learning, 

Also, I like to read technical blogs. I have listed them [here](https://er-knight.github.io/blogs/).  
Do you participate in Programming Contests? [This](https://er-knight.github.io/contests/) might come handy.  
Do you like anime? [This](http://animeshare.onrender.com/) might be of your interest.
