:wave: Hi, my name is Ajay. I am developer, trying to craft softwares (not succeeded in that so far :stuck_out_tongue:).  
So far, I have used, Python, FastAPI, JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS and Selenium.

I love learning anything (even remotely) related to software development - mostly the internals of any software.

Currently, I am learning,
- Golang
- AWS

Some of my favourite things are,
- List comprehension in Python (loves to one-liners whenever possible)
- React + TailwindCSS + Vite (best for my not-so-good projects)
- Github Actions (Give it a try)
