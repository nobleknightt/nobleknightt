:wave: Hi, my name is Ajay.  
I write code (really), build softwares (that's what I think), (try) to solve LeetCode problems (there are really hard to solve for me).   
Sometimes I build random things and (try to learn random things). I am trying to learn every programming language out there (and now I am lost).

By the way, nice to see you here :blush:. Have a good day!

Below are some more info about me if you want.

#### :wave: Hi, my name is Ajay. 
I am developer (pragmatic pessimist maybe?), trying to craft softwares (not succeeded in that so far :stuck_out_tongue:).  
So far, I have used, Python, FastAPI, JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS and Selenium.

I love learning anything (even remotely) related to software development - mostly the internals of any software.

Currently, I am learning,
- Golang
- AWS

Some of my favourite things are,
- List comprehension in Python (loves to one-liners whenever possible)
- React + TailwindCSS + Vite (best for my not-so-good projects)
- Github Actions (Give it a try)

I am interested in Compiler Design, Cryptography, Machine Learning, 

Also, I like to read technical blogs. I have listed them [here](https://er-knight.github.io/blogs/).  
Do you participate in Programming Contests? [This](https://er-knight.github.io/contests/) might come handy.  
Do you like anime? [This](http://animeshare.onrender.com/) might be of your interest.
